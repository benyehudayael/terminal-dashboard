# AngularTerminalDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1.
This is a web interface project that simulates airport activity based on data coming from the [Bakand project](https://github.com/benyehudayael/TerminalDashboard) that I built separately.
### On the site you can see two different views:
### Dashboard -
Displays the details of upcoming flights.
### Simulator - 
Presents a visual simulation of takeoffs, landings and aircraft parking at the airport.
The data is constantly updated at regular times.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Built With
